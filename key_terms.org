NOTE: Be sure, when you are searching that they are logical defintions, that is
they are definitions that relate to math and Logic.

Example
* Superman Cannot be jumping really high
** identify
Superman is sometimes debated around his flying abilities
Some say that he is merely jumping and due to his speed and 
strength it appears to you and I that he is merely jumping and
moving his body to go up and down after that.
** Define
This is obviously false.  Superman is indeed levitating and not
Jumping
** Example/Explanation
If Superman were jumping when he catches Lois Lane she would be cut in half
due to the speed and trajectory of superman being the man of steel. This is because
he would have to slow/stop to the same speed as Lois to catch her and then "rejump".
He visually does not appear to be 'rejumping' and Lois isnt cut in half.  DONE!
** Non-Trivial Test question
What would be the best way to describe Superman's flight


a. He jumps and with his strength and speed is able to alter his path


b. He flys like a bird and flaps his wings


c. He levitates, he's an alien "HEELLLLLOOOO!"


d. Why do I care about Superman again, he's in the D.C. universe ... so dark and terrible movies!
